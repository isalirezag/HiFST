Reference:
Spatially-Varying Blur Detection Based on Multiscale Fused and Sorted
Transform Coefficients of Gradient Magnitudes  CVPR 2017.

Usage:
--------------------------------------------
Run the Demo to make sure the code works successfuly with your system and then you can use HiFST to detect the blur for other images.
Please make sure to clear the paths in your matlab so you do not receive error.


[InputImg FinalMap] = HiFST(InputImg,Slid,Noise)
Slid = 1;
Noise = the variance of the noise you like to add.


In Resutls folder we provided the results of our method for images of the database that mentioned in the paper.
In MoreImages, more results are provided.
